# ClientSideScripting-Project
Finale project for Client-Side Scripting course at La Salle University
For this project, we were tasked with developing a web application that met a range of specific requirements. For my project subject, I chose a resturant website. I incorporated menu data from an external sources using a JSON files, ensuring the project was dynamic. The application included five HTML pages, each with over ten elements such as headers, paragraphs, tables, and various input types. I used both select and input elements, with user input influencing the page's output. The project also utilized Vue and React for front-end logic, adding interactive elements to both pages. Each page was styled with more than 20 CSS attribute-value pairs and employed modern CSS techniques, including grid layouts and transitions. Additionally, I implemented meta tags for charset, author, description, keywords, and included extra tags for SEO purposes. I ensured user interaction was smooth, with error handling to prevent crashes from bad data inputs or out-of-order actions. My code included loops, arrays, and objects for logic control, alongside string manipulation and calculations. While meeting the minimum requirements, I extended the project by using more complex React logic and included additional features like regular expressions to enhance functionality.
